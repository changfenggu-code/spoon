# Scoop Package Manager

Manage the scoop package manager and all development software installed through it on Windows.

## Side Effects Reporting

**CRITICAL**: After any operation that changes system-level state (install, uninstall, update, bucket changes, etc.), always summarize the side effects to the user. This includes:

- Environment variables added, modified, or removed
- PATH entries added or removed
- Directories created or deleted
- Shims created or removed
- Shortcuts added or removed
- Any other system-level changes

Present the summary as a clear list so the user knows exactly what changed on their system.

## Install Scoop

### Step 1: Detect existing installation

Run `scoop --version` to check if scoop is already installed.

- If installed: report the current version and install path (`$env:SCOOP` or default `~/scoop`). Ask the user whether to **update**, **reconfigure**, or **skip**.
- If not installed: proceed with installation.

### Step 2: Confirm install path

Use AskUserQuestion to let the user choose an install directory:

- Option 1: `D:\Scoop` (Recommended) — separate directory, keeps C: drive clean
- Option 2: `~/scoop` — scoop default location
- Option 3: Custom path — user provides their own

### Step 3: Check if target directory exists

Before installing, check if the chosen directory already exists:

- **Directory exists and contains a scoop installation** (has `apps/`, `shims/`, etc.): this is likely a previous scoop install. Ask the user whether to **reuse it** (skip install, just verify), **wipe and reinstall**, or **choose a different path**.
- **Directory exists but is not a scoop installation**: warn the user that the directory is not empty. Ask whether to **use it anyway** (scoop will install into it), **wipe it first**, or **choose a different path**.
- **Directory does not exist**: proceed normally.

### Step 4: Run the installer

Download and execute the official installer with the chosen path:

```powershell
powershell -Command "irm get.scoop.sh -outfile 'install.ps1'; .\install.ps1 -ScoopDir '<chosen_path>'"
```

The installer automatically sets the `SCOOP` user environment variable pointing to the install directory.

Available installer parameters (use when relevant):
- `-ScoopDir` — scoop install directory
- `-NoProxy` — bypass system proxy during installation

The following parameters require administrator privileges. Do NOT use unless the user explicitly requests:
- `-ScoopGlobalDir` — global apps install directory (requires admin)
- `-RunAsAdmin` — admin mode installation (requires elevated console)

**Shell environment note**: The installer writes environment variables to the Windows registry via `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable`. However, the Bash tool in Claude Code inherits its environment from the **parent VSCode process**, not from the registry. This means:

- Within the same VSCode window (even new conversations): bash will NOT see the new PATH/SCOOP
- After restarting VSCode: bash will pick up the new environment
- Even `powershell -Command "scoop ..."` may NOT work immediately, because the new PowerShell process inherits PATH from bash (its parent), not from the registry

**Recommended approach**: Use `skills/scripts/run-cmd.ps1` (relative to the plugin root) to refresh PATH from the registry before running any command. This avoids bash/PowerShell quoting conflicts with `$env`, `$null`, etc.

Resolve the absolute path of `skills/scripts/run-cmd.ps1` based on the plugin root directory, then use it with `powershell -File`:

```bash
# Example (replace <plugin_root> with the plugin's absolute path):
powershell -File <plugin_root>/skills/scripts/run-cmd.ps1 scoop --version
powershell -File <plugin_root>/skills/scripts/run-cmd.ps1 scoop install git
powershell -File <plugin_root>/skills/scripts/run-cmd.ps1 scoop bucket add extras
powershell -File <plugin_root>/skills/scripts/run-cmd.ps1 git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

For non-scoop PowerShell commands (e.g., setting environment variables), use `powershell -Command` with single quotes in bash to protect `$` from bash interpolation:

```bash
powershell -Command '[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("SCOOP", "D:\Scoop", "User")'
```

**Important caveats when mixing bash and PowerShell**:
- `$env:Path`, `$null`, etc. get swallowed by bash — use single quotes or a `.ps1` file
- Use `[NullString]::Value` instead of `$null` when clearing env vars via `-Command`
- Prefer `-File` over `-Command` for anything beyond simple one-liners

Alternatively, refresh the bash environment directly:

```bash
export SCOOP=$(powershell -Command "[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('SCOOP', 'User')")
export PATH="$SCOOP/shims:$PATH"
```

Advise the user to **restart VSCode** after installation is complete so that all future sessions have the correct environment natively.

### Step 5: Install and configure git

Scoop buckets are managed by git. Immediately after installing scoop, install git and gh (GitHub CLI):

```bash
powershell -Command "scoop install git gh"
```

git is mandatory — without it, bucket operations (add, update) will not work.
gh is strongly recommended — it enables GitHub release downloads, repo management, and is used by some post-install recipes.

After installing git, add git's bash and Unix tools to PATH. Scoop only shims a few binaries (`git`, `sh`, `git-bash`), but `bash.exe` and Unix utilities (`less`, `awk`, etc.) live in git's own directories and need explicit PATH entries:

```bash
# Add git's bin and usr/bin to user PATH
powershell -File <plugin_root>/skills/scripts/add-path.ps1 git bin usr/bin
```

When uninstalling git (or scoop), remove these PATH entries:

```bash
powershell -File <plugin_root>/skills/scripts/add-path.ps1 git bin usr/bin -Remove
```

Note: The scoop uninstall cleanup (`-notmatch "Scoop"`) already covers these entries since the paths contain "Scoop". The `-Remove` flag is for cases where git is uninstalled individually while scoop remains.

Then apply essential configuration:

1. **Set default branch to main** (always, no need to ask):
   ```bash
   powershell -Command "git config --global init.defaultBranch main"
   ```

2. **Ask user for name and email** via AskUserQuestion. These are required for git commits.
   If the user skips, warn that commits will fail without them.
   ```bash
   powershell -Command "git config --global user.name '<name>'"
   powershell -Command "git config --global user.email '<email>'"
   ```

3. **Check if there are other existing git configs** — if the user already has a `~/.gitconfig`, report its contents and ask before overwriting any values.

### Step 6: Confirm and add buckets

Use AskUserQuestion with multiSelect to let the user pick buckets to add:

- `extras` (Recommended — common GUI apps and dev tools)
- `versions` (older/alternative versions of software)
- `java` (JDK distributions: adoptium, zulu, etc.)
- `nerd-fonts` (patched developer fonts)

The user can also specify additional buckets via the "Other" option.

Add each selected bucket: `powershell -Command "scoop bucket add <name>"`

### Step 7: Run scoop update

After adding buckets, run `scoop update` to pull the latest bucket manifests via git:

```bash
powershell -Command "scoop update"
```

This verifies that git is working correctly with scoop and ensures all bucket data is up to date.

### Side effects summary after install

Report to the user:
- `SCOOP` environment variable set to `<install_path>`
- `<install_path>\shims` added to user PATH
- git installed at `<install_path>\apps\git\current`
- gh installed at `<install_path>\apps\gh\current`
- Buckets cloned to `<install_path>\buckets\`
- Directories created: `<install_path>\{apps,buckets,cache,persist,shims}`

## Uninstall Scoop

This is a destructive, irreversible operation. Always confirm with the user before proceeding.

1. Ask the user to confirm they want to uninstall scoop and all installed packages.
2. Run `powershell -Command "scoop uninstall scoop"` (removes scoop and all scoop-installed apps).
3. Clean up environment variables (use `[NullString]::Value` instead of `$null` because `$null` gets swallowed by bash):
   ```bash
   powershell -Command "[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SCOOP', [NullString]::Value, 'User')"
   ```
   If the user had global installs enabled (requires admin):
   ```bash
   powershell -Command "[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SCOOP_GLOBAL', [NullString]::Value, 'Machine')"
   ```
4. Remove scoop-related entries from PATH:
   ```bash
   powershell -Command '$path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User"); $cleaned = ($path -split ";" | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch "Scoop" }) -join ";"; [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $cleaned, "User")'
   ```
5. Delete the install directory. **Important**: scoop uses NTFS junctions (e.g., `current` → version dir). PowerShell's `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` cannot delete junctions. Use `cmd /c rmdir /s /q` instead:
   ```bash
   powershell -Command "& cmd /c 'rmdir /s /q <install_path>'"
   ```
6. **Report side effects**: list all environment variables removed, PATH entries removed, and directories deleted.

## Proxy and Mirror Configuration

Proxy and mirror management is handled by the **`proxy` skill**. This skill covers all tools (git, scoop, npm, pip, cargo, flutter, etc.) in a unified way.

When a scoop operation fails with a network/SSL error, or the user asks about proxy/mirror settings, delegate to the `proxy` skill.

During scoop installation (Step 5, after git is installed), the `proxy` skill should be consulted to detect existing proxy and sync to scoop if needed.

## Daily Operations

### Search for packages
```bash
powershell -Command "scoop search <query>"
```

### Install a package
```bash
powershell -Command "scoop install <app>"
```
After installing, check if a recipe exists in `references/recipes/` for the app. If found (e.g., `references/recipes/claude-code.md`), read it and follow the post-install configuration steps.

Report side effects: shims created, PATH changes, environment variables set by the app.

### Uninstall a package
```bash
powershell -Command "scoop uninstall <app>"
```
Report side effects: shims removed, any environment variables or PATH entries cleaned up.

### Update
```bash
powershell -Command "scoop update"            # update scoop itself and bucket manifests
powershell -Command "scoop update *"          # update all installed packages
powershell -Command "scoop update <app>"      # update a specific package
```

### View status
```bash
powershell -Command "scoop list"             # list installed packages
powershell -Command "scoop status"           # show packages that can be updated
powershell -Command "scoop info <app>"       # show detailed info about a package
```

### Bucket management
```bash
powershell -Command "scoop bucket list"          # list added buckets
powershell -Command "scoop bucket add <name>"    # add a bucket
powershell -Command "scoop bucket rm <name>"     # remove a bucket
powershell -Command "scoop bucket known"         # list all known official buckets
```

### Maintenance
```bash
powershell -Command "scoop cleanup *"        # remove old versions of all apps
powershell -Command "scoop cleanup <app>"    # remove old versions of a specific app
powershell -Command "scoop cache rm *"       # clear the download cache
powershell -Command "scoop checkup"          # run a health check on scoop
powershell -Command "scoop reset <app>"      # reset an app (re-link shims and shortcuts)
```

## Recipes

For tools that need post-install configuration beyond just `scoop install`, recipe files are stored in `references/recipes/`. Each recipe describes environment variables to set, config files to create, or verification steps to run after installation.

When installing a tool, check for a matching recipe and apply it automatically.
